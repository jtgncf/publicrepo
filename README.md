## 🧠 Coursework

### 🔹 Intro to Python
- **Topics Covered**: Variables, loops, conditionals, functions, basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.)
- **Projects**: Small console-based projects focused on logic and algorithmic thinking.

### 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming in Java
- **Topics Covered**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, exception handling.
- **Projects**: Console-based applications and mini-games to demonstrate understanding of OOP principles.

### 🔹 2D Game Development in C++ with SFML
- **Language Skills**: Procedural and Object-Oriented C++, structs, enums, typedefs.
- **Tools**: SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- **Projects**:
  - Classic arcade-style games
  - Game loop implementation
  - Sprite handling, collision detection, basic physics

### 🔹 Computer Architecture (Nand2Tetris)
- **Concepts Learned**:
  - Boolean logic
  - Building a CPU from logic gates
  - Writing an assembler and virtual machine
  - High-level language compilation
- **Projects**:
  - 16-bit computer built from NAND gates
  - Custom Assembler in Rust (WIP)
